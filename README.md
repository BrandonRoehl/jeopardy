# jeopardy
This is just a simple JavaFX app for a jeopardy program. The program reads in a csv for the contents so edit in your favorite program for csvs.
The first row is the title of the section then a cell for space.
From then on just format every row just alternat cells in Question, Answer, ... format
For examples check out the [example\_csvs](https://github.com/BrandonRoehl/jeopardy/tree/master/example_csvs) folder.
